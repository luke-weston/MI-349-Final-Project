    <h1>About</h1>
    <p id="aboutpage">My name is Luke Weston. I am a senior at MSU and I hope to become an accomplished web designer.
    I really like coding in Python and C++, but I am in the process of learning Javascript. I like to 
    cook, play guitar and piano, and play Smash Bros with my friends and family. Thanks for checking 
    out my project.
